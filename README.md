# Khan IT Homepage Recreation (First Sections)

A pixel-accurate, responsive recreation of the first few sections of the **Khan IT** official website (khanit.com.bd) using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no build tools.

This project was created as a front-end coding challenge demonstration (January 2026).

## Sections Implemented

1. **Header / Navigation Bar**  
   - Sticky header with logo, main menu, dropdown indicator, and call-to-action phone button  
   - Fully responsive mobile menu with toggle (hamburger)

2. **Hero Section**  
   - Large headline  
   - Stats cards (200% conversions, 500+ clients, 98% success, 24h support)  
   - Video case study placeholder (Walton)  
   - Short description text  
   - Prominent "Book Your Free Consultation" CTA button  
   - Testimonial snippet

3. **Clients / Case Studies Section**  
   - "Real Clients, Real Growth" heading  
   - 4 client cards (Walton, Hatil, Mir Cement, IFAD Group) with logos, growth stats, description, and "View Case Study" buttons

4. **Ready to Grow CTA Section**  
   - Full-width blue section with headline and consultation booking CTA

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic structure)  
- CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid, mobile-first responsive design, modern gradients & shadows)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (only for mobile menu toggle)

**No external CSS/JS frameworks** were used (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind, no jQuery, etc.)

- Mobile menu toggle with smooth open/close  
- Clean, maintainable component-based CSS structure  
- Modern color scheme matching the original website  
- Smooth hover effects and subtle animations
